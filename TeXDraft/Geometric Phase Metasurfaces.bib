abstract = {The polarization of light plays a central role in its interaction with matter, in situations ranging from familiar (for example, reflection and transmission at an interface) to sophisticated (for example, nonlinear optics). Polarization control is therefore pivotal for many optical systems, and achieved using bulk devices such as wave-plates and beam-splitters. The move towards optical system miniaturization therefore motivates the development of micro- and nanostructures for polarization control. For such control to be complete, one must distinguish not only between linear polarizations, but also between left- and right-circular polarizations. Some previous works used surface plasmons to this end, but these are inherently lossy. Other works used complex-layered structures. Here we demonstrate a planar dielectric chirality-distinguishing beam-splitter. The beam-splitter consists of amorphous silicon nanofins on a glass substrate and deflects left- and right-circularly polarized beams into different directions. Contrary to intuitive expectations, we utilize an achiral architecture to realize a chiral beam-splitting functionality.},

The significance is that their anomalous transmission efficiency almost reaches the theoretical limit of 25{\%}, showing a remarkable improvement compared with earlier ultrathin metasurface designs with less than 5{\%} coupling efficiency. The planar metalens proposed empowers significant reduction in thickness, versatile focusing behavior, and high transmission efficiency simultaneously.},

abstract = {We report on the observation of optical spin-controlled modes from a quasicrystalline metasurface as a result of an aperiodic geometric phase induced by anisotropic subwavelength structure. When geometric phase defects are introduced in the aperiodic structured surface, the modes exhibit polarization helicity dependence resulting in the optical spin-Hall effect. The radiative thermal dispersion bands from a quasicrystal structure are studied where the observed bands arise from the optical spin-orbit interaction induced by the aperiodic space-variant orientations of anisotropic antennas. The optical spin-flip behavior of the revealed modes that arise from the geometric phase pickup is experimentally observed within the visible spectrum by measuring the spin-projected diffraction patterns. The introduced ability to manipulate the light-matter interaction of quasicrystals in a spin-dependent manner provides the route for molding light via spin-optical aperiodic artificial planar surfaces.},

abstract = {Metal-dielectric-graphene three-layer structures are proposed to improve the interaction of graphene micro- and nanostructures with incident waves, as the upper graphene cut-wire layer introduces a discontinuous Pancharatnam-Berry phase profile. A semi-analytical method based on the Jones calculus is conducted to investigate the conversion efficiency of cross-polarized light on this graphene metasurface for circularly polarized wave incidence, which predicts that the physical constraint (25{\%}) of cross-coupling conversion efficiency for individual graphene layers can be overcome. Numerical simulations confirm the conclusion and demonstrate an efficiency as high as 60{\%}. Based on this mechanism, high-efficiency anomalous reflection surfaces and flat focal mirrors are designed with the tunability of reflection angles and one order of magnitude improved focusing intensity. This method paves the way to engineering high-efficiency graphene metasurfaces for tunable electromagnetic wave manipulation.},

abstract = {Gradient metasurfaces are two-dimensional optical elements capable of manipulating light by imparting local, space-variant phase changes on an incident electromagnetic wave. These surfaces have thus far been constructed from nanometallic optical antennas, and high diffraction efficiencies have been limited to operation in reflection mode. We describe the experimental realization and operation of dielectric gradient metasurface optical elements capable of also achieving high efficiencies in transmission mode in the visible spectrum. Ultrathin gratings, lenses, and axicons have been realized by patterning a 100-nanometer-thick Si layer into a dense arrangement of Si nanobeam antennas. The use of semiconductors can broaden the general applicability of gradient metasurfaces, as they offer facile integration with electronics and can be realized by mature semiconductor fabrication technologies.},

abstract = {Metasurfaces are engineered interfaces that contain a thin layer of plasmonic or dielectric nanostructures capable of manipulating light in a desirable manner. Advances in metasurfaces have led to various practical applications ranging from lensing to holography. Metasurface holograms that can be switched by the polarization state of incident light have been demonstrated for achieving polarization multiplexed functionalities. However, practical application of these devices has been limited by their capability for achieving high efficiency and high image quality. Here we experimentally demonstrate a helicity multiplexed metasurface hologram with high efficiency and good image fidelity over a broad range of frequencies. The metasurface hologram features the combination of two sets of hologram patterns operating with opposite incident helicities. Two symmetrically distributed off-axis images are interchangeable by controlling the helicity of the input light. The demonstrated helicity multiplexed metasurface hologram with its high performance opens avenues for future applications with functionality switchable optical devices.},

abstract = {Two-dimensional metasurface structures have recently been proposed to reduce the challenges of fabrication of traditional plasmonic metamaterials. However, complex designs and sophisticated fabrication procedures are still required. Here, we present a unique one-dimensional (1-D) metasurface based on bilayered metallic nanowire gratings, which behaves as an ideal polarized beam splitter, producing strong negative reflection for transverse-magnetic (TM) light and efficient reflection for transverse-electric (TE) light. The large anisotropy resulting from this TE-metal-like/TM-dielectric-like feature can be explained by the dispersion curve based on the Bloch theory of periodic metal-insulator-metal waveguides. The results indicate that this photon manipulation mechanism is fundamentally different from those previously proposed for 2-D or 3-D metastructures. Based on this new material platform, a novel form of metasurface holography is proposed and demonstrated, in which an image can only be reconstructed by using a TM light beam. By reducing the metamaterial structures to 1-D, our metasurface beam splitter exhibits the qualities of cost-efficient fabrication, robust performance, and high tunability, in addition to its applicability over a wide range of working wavelengths and incident angles. This development paves a foundation for metasurface structure designs towards practical metamaterial applications.},

We propose and experimentally demonstrate a simple and compact approach to measure the ellipticity and handedness of the polarized light using an ultrathin (40 nm) gradient metasurface. A completely polarized light beam is decomposed into a left circularly polarized beam and a right circularly polarized beam, which are steered in two directions by the metasurface consisting of nanorods with spatially varying orientations. By measuring the intensities of the refracted light spots, the ellipticity and handedness of various incident polarization states are characterized at a range of wavelengths and used to determine the polarization information of the incident beam. To fully characterize the polarization state of light, an extra polarizer can be used to measure the polarization azimuth angle of the incident light.},

@article{Martini2015,
abstract = {Metasurfaces (MTSs) constitute a class of thin metamaterials used for controlling plane waves and surface waves (SWs). At microwave frequencies, they are constituted by a metallic texture with elements of sub-wavelength size printed on thin grounded dielectric substrates. These structures support the propagation of SWs. By averaging the tangential fields, the MTSs can be characterized through homogenized isotropic or anisotropic boundary conditions, which can be described through a homogeneous equivalent impedance. This impedance can be spatially modulated by locally changing the size/orientation of the texture elements. This allows for a deformation of the SW wavefront which addresses the local wavevector along not-rectilinear paths. The effect of the MTS modulation can be analysed in the framework of transformation optics. This article reviews theory and implementation of this MTS transformation and shows some examples at microwave frequencies.},

Among the various types of metasurfaces, geometric metasurfaces, which consist of an array of plasmonic nanorods with spatially varying orientations, have shown superior phase control due to the geometric nature of their phase profile. Metasurfaces have recently been used to make computer-generated holograms, but the hologram efficiency remained too low at visible wavelengths for practical purposes. Here, we report the design and realization of a geometric metasurface hologram reaching diffraction efficiencies of 80{\%} at 825 nm and a broad bandwidth between 630 nm and 1,050 nm. The 16-level-phase computer-generated hologram demonstrated here combines the advantages of a geometric metasurface for the superior control of the phase profile and of reflectarrays for achieving high polarization conversion efficiency. Specifically, the design of the hologram integrates a ground metal plane with a geometric metasurface that enhances the conversion efficiency between the two circular polarization states, leading to high diffraction efficiency without complicating the fabrication process. Because of these advantages, our strategy could be viable for various practical holographic applications.},
