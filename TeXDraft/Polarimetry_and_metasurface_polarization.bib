abstract = {A division-of-amplitude photopolarimeter (DOAP) is described that employs a diffraction grating in the conventional spectrometer orientation with the grating grooves normal to the plane of incidence. Four coplanar diffracted orders are used for polarimetric analysis to determine all four Stokes parameters of incident light simultaneously and virtually instantaneously (with the speed being determined solely by the photodetectors and their associated electronics); a fifth order is used for alignment by autocollimation or by use of a position-sensing quadrant detector. To sensitize the instrument for the +45° and −45° azimuths of incident linearly polarized light and for the handedness of incident circular polarization (i.e., for the third and fourth Stokes parameters), we insert two linear polarizers in two diffracted orders with their transmission axes inclined at appropriate angles with respect to the plane of incidence. The calibration and testing of an instrument of this type that uses an Al-coated 600-groove/mm holographic grating at 632.8-nm wavelength are reported as an example.},

The sample polarization properties can be described more thoroughly through its Mueller matrix, which can be derived from judiciously chosen input polarization Stokes vectors and correspondingly measured output Stokes vectors. However, several sources of error complicate the construction of a Mueller matrix from the measured Stokes vectors. Here we present a general formalism to examine these sources of error and their effects on the derived Mueller matrix, and identify the optimal input polarization states to minimize their effects in a dual photoelastic modulator polarimeter configuration. The input Stokes vector states leading to the most robust Mueller matrix determination are shown to form Platonic solids in the Poincar{\'{e}} sphere space; we also identify the optimal 3D orientation of these solids for error minimization.},

abstract = {The first three columns of the instrument matrix A of the four-detector photopolarimeter (FDP) are determined by Fourier analysis of the output current vector I(P) as a function of the azimuth angle P of the incident linearly polarized light. Therefore 12 of the 16 elements of A are measured free of the imperfections of the (absent) quarter-wave retarder (QWR). The effect of angular beam deviation by the polarizer is compensated for by taking the average, (1/2) $\backslash$[I(P) + I(P + 180{\{}$\backslash$textdegree{\}})$\backslash$], of the FDP output at 180{\{}$\backslash$textdegree{\}}-apart, optically equivalent, angular positions of the polarizer. The remaining fourth column of A is determined by the FDP's response to the right- and left-handed circular polarization states. Because these states are impossible to generate with an imperfect QWR, a novel procedure is developed. In particular, the response of the FDP to the unattainable right- or left-handed circular polarization state is found by taking the average of the responses of the FDP to an elliptical near-circular state and that state rotated in azimuth by 90{\{}$\backslash$textdegree{\}}. This calibration scheme is applied to measure A of our prototype FDP of four Si detectors at $\lambda$ = 632.8 nm. A is determined, in external and internal reference frames, free of imperfections in the polarizing optical elements. The FDP, with its uncontaminated A matrix, is used subsequently to evaluate the imperfections of the QWR with the help of an appropriate model.},

abstract = {Polarization-difference (PD) imaging techniques have been demonstrated to improve the detectability of target features that are embedded in scattering media. The improved detectability occurs for both passive imaging in moderately scattering media ({\textless}5 optical depths) and active imaging in more highly scattering media. These improvements are relative to what is possible with equivalent polarization-blind, polarization-sum (PS) imaging under the same conditions. In this investigation, the point-spread functions (PSF's) for passive PS and PD imaging in single-scattering media are studied analytically, and Monte Carlo simulations are used to study the PSF's in single- and moderately multiple-scattering media. The results indicate that the PD PSF can be significantly narrower than the corresponding PS PSF, implying that better images of target features with high-spatial-frequency information can be obtained by using differential polarimetry in scattering media. Although the analysis was performed for passive imaging at moderate optical depths, the results lend insight into experiments that have been performed in more highly scattering media with active imaging methods to help mitigate the effects of multiple scattering.},

We show an operational bandwidth Deltalambda/lambda0 approximately 56{\%} (roughly spanning visible wavelength range) that represents more than a fourfold increase of bandwidth over conventional PGs (and significantly larger than any other grating). The diffraction angle and operational region (visible, near-infrared, midwave infrared, and ultraviolet wavelengths) may be easily tailored during fabrication. The essence of the achromatic design is a stack of two chiral PGs with an opposite twist sense and employs the principle of retardation compensation.

abstract = {Polarimetry has a long and successful history in various forms of clear media. Driven by their biomedical potential, the use of the polarimetric approaches for biological tissue assessment has also recently received considerable attention. Specifically, polarization can be used as an effective tool to discriminate against multiply scattered light (acting as a gating mechanism) in order to enhance contrast and to improve tissue imaging resolution. Moreover, the intrinsic tissue polarimetry characteristics contain a wealth of morphological and functional information of potential biomedical importance. However, in a complex random medium-like tissue, numerous complexities due to multiple scattering and simultaneous occurrences of many scattering and polarization events present formidable challenges both in terms of accurate measurements and in terms of analysis of the tissue polarimetry signal. In order to realize the potential of the polarimetric approaches for tissue imaging and characterization/diagnosis, a number of researchers are thus pursuing innovative solutions to these challenges. In this review paper, we summarize these and other issues pertinent to the polarized light methodologies in tissues. Specifically, we discuss polarized light basics, Stokes-Muller formalism, methods of polarization measurements, polarized light modeling in turbid media, applications to tissue imaging, inverse analysis for polarimetric results quantification, applications to quantitative tissue assessment, etc.},

This is valuable for ordered and isotropic materials alike. Similarly, the 4-element Stokes vector is the most complete description of the polarization of a light beam, including any depolarization effects. While the Mueller matrix offers the most chemical and physical insight, the Stokes vectors are easier to obtain, and there are more schemes for measuring them quickly in situations where time resolution is important.

Transmissive metasurfaces are especially important, as most optical systems used in practice operate in transmission. Several types of transmissive metasurface have been realized, but with either low transmission efficiencies or limited control over polarization and phase. Here, we show a metasurface platform based on high-contrast dielectric elliptical nanoposts that provides complete control of polarization and phase with subwavelength spatial resolution and an experimentally measured efficiency ranging from 72{\%} to 97{\%}, depending on the exact design. Such complete control enables the realization of most free-space transmissive optical elements such as lenses, phase plates, wave plates, polarizers, beamsplitters, as well as polarization-switchable phase holograms and arbitrary vector beam generators using the same metamaterial platform.},

abstract = {Many astronomical objects emit polarised light, which can give information both about their source mechanisms, and about (scattering) geometry in their source regions. To date (mostly) only the linearly polarised components of the emission have been observed in stellar sources. Observations have been constrained because of instrumental considerations to periods of excellent observing conditions, and to steady, slowly or periodically-varying sources. This leaves a whole range of interesting objects beyond the range of observation at present. The Galway Astronomical Stokes Polarimeter (GASP) has been developed to enable us to make observations on these very sources. GASP measures the four components of the Stokes Vector simultaneously over a broad wavelength range 400-800nm., with a time resolution of order microseconds given suitable detectors and a bright source - this is possible because the optical design contains no moving or modulating components. The initial design of GASP is presented and we include some preliminary observational results demonstrating that components of the Stokes vector can be measured to {\textless}1{\%} in conditions of poor atmospheric stability. Issues of efficiency and stability are addressed. An analysis of suitable astronomical targets, demanding the unique properties of GASP, is also presented.},

abstract = {The first three columns of the instrument matrix A of the four-detector photopolarimeter (FDP) are determined by Fourier analysis of the output current vector I(P) as a function of the azimuth angle P of the incident linearly polarized light. Therefore 12 of the 16 elements of A are measured free of the imperfections of the (absent) quarter-wave retarder (QWR). The effect of angular beam deviation by the polarizer is compensated for by taking the average, (1/2) $\backslash$[I(P) + I(P + 180{\{}$\backslash$textdegree{\}})$\backslash$], of the FDP output at 180{\{}$\backslash$textdegree{\}}-apart, optically equivalent, angular positions of the polarizer. The remaining fourth column of A is determined by the FDP's response to the right- and left-handed circular polarization states. Because these states are impossible to generate with an imperfect QWR, a novel procedure is developed. In particular, the response of the FDP to the unattainable right- or left-handed circular polarization state is found by taking the average of the responses of the FDP to an elliptical near-circular state and that state rotated in azimuth by 90{\{}$\backslash$textdegree{\}}. This calibration scheme is applied to measure A of our prototype FDP of four Si detectors at $\lambda$ = 632.8 nm. A is determined, in external and internal reference frames, free of imperfections in the polarizing optical elements. The FDP, with its uncontaminated A matrix, is used subsequently to evaluate the imperfections of the QWR with the help of an appropriate model.},

abstract = {A new photopolarimeter for the simultaneous measurement of all four Stokes parameters of light is described. The light beam, whose state of polarization is to be determined, strikes at oblique incidence three photodetector surfaces in succession, each of which is partially specularly reflecting and each of which generates an electrical signal proportional to the fraction of the radiation that it absorbs. A fourth photodetector captures the remainder of the light. The four outputs thus developed form a 4 x 1 signal vector I, which is linearly related, I = AS, to the input Stokes vector S. Consequently, S is obtained by S = A(-1)I. The 4 x 4 instrument matrix A must be nonsingular, and this requires that the light beam not remain in one plane. For a given arrangement of four detectors, A can be either computed or determined by calibration. The advantages of this polarimeter are enumerated.},

Results demonstrating the effectiveness of this method, obtained with Monte Carlo techniques, show that the visibility depth can be increased by as much as a mean free path.

abstract = {This paper introduces the new Polarization and Directionality of the Earth's Reflectances (POLDER) instrument. The spaceborne POLDER sensor, which is selected to fly aboard the Japanese ADEOS satellite scheduled for launch in early 1996, has nearly complete phase C of its development at the Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales, the French space agency. To prepare for the 1996 space mission, airborne prototypes are being tested and evaluated in the framework of various measurement campaigns. The POLDER sensor is designed to collect global observations of polarized and directional solar radiation reflected by the Earth-atmosphere system for climate and global change studies. Aboard the ADEOS platform, the POLDER mission will provide near-daily coverage of the Earth at 6 x 7 km2 resolution. The POLDER system will offer unprecedented opportunities to observe biophysical parameters over the oceans and land surfaces. The sensor's unique features, when compared to current and planned spaceborne instruments, include its ability to: 1) measure polarized reflectance in the visible and near-infrared spectral regions; 2) observe Earth target reflectance from 12 directions during a single satellite pass; and 3) operate in two dynamic modes in order o achieve both high signal to noise ratio and wide dynamic range. Six of POLDER's eight channels are optimized for observing a atmospheric aerosols, clouds, ocean color, and land surfaces. The other two are centered on the H20 and 02 absorption bands for retrieving atmospheric water vapor amount and cloud top altitude, respectively. POLDER data will be subject to the high calibration standards defined by the POLDER mission team, with absolute calibration accuracies of 2{\%} for the shorter wavelength channels (lambda less-than-or-equal-to 565 nm) and 3{\%} for the longer wavelengths. A 1{\%} accuracy is the goal for the intercalibration between the spectral channels. The POLDER instrument aboard ADEOS will contribute significantly to climate-related research on aerosol cycling, cloud-radiation interactions, the Earth radiation budget, ocean primary productivity, and continental biosphere dynamics. Using POLDER capability to measure bidirectional reflectance and polarization distribution in functions for estimating biophysical parameters, the POLDER mission's scientific objectives will be to: 1) map atmospheric aerosols, including their sources and transport, and study their influence on the Earth radiation budget; 2) assess cloud properties, namely their height, phase and type; 3) estimate total integrated water vapor amount; 4) improve Earth radiation budget estimates; 5) estimate chlorophyll-like pigment content in the ocean surface layer and its role in the carbon cycle; and 6) characterize land surface properties and vegetation cover. In meeting these objectives, POLDER will play an important role in advancing the measurement and research objectives of the World Climate Research Program (WCRP) and the International Geosphere and Biosphere Program (IGBP).},

abstract = {Polarization-difference imaging (PDI) was recently presented by us as a method of imaging through scattering media [Opt. Lett. 20, 608 (1995)]. Here, PDI is compared with conventional, polarizationblind imaging systems under a variety of conditions not previously studied. Through visual and numerical comparison of polarization-difference and polarization-sum images of metallic targets suspended in scattering media, target features initially visible in both types of images are shown to disappear in polarization-sum images as the scatterer concentration is increased, whereas these features remain visible in polarization-difference images. Target features producing an observed degree of linear polarization of less than 1{\%} are visible in polarization-difference images. The ability of PDI to suppress partially polarized background variations selectively is demonstrated, and discrimination of target features on the basis of polarization information is discussed. Our results show that, when compared with conventional imaging, PDI yields a factor of 2-3 increase in the distance at which certain target features can be detected.},

abstract = {A computer‐controlled four‐detector photopolarimeter (FDP) has been constructed using four windowless planar‐diffused Si photodiodes, operational amplifiers, an analog‐to‐digital (A/D) converter, and a personal computer with peripherals. A nonplanar light path is selected with incidence angles at the first three detectors of ∼65° and with rotations of ∼45° between the successive planes of incidence. The last detector, which is coated for minimum reflectance, intercepts the beam at a small angle and the residual light it reflects is dumped. A 1‐mW He–Ne laser beam ($\lambda$=632.8 nm) passes through the polarizing optics of an ellipsometer to provide the polarization states needed for calibration and testing. With an optimum set of calibration states, the instrument matrix A is determined. The FDP is subsequently tested and found to correctly measure the normalized Stokes parameters of a large number of states with an average absolute error of ∼0.01, which is attributed to imperfections in the calibration optics. This first prototype instrument has a precision of ∼0.2{\%}.},

Recently, the concept of polarimeters based on the conical refraction (CR) phenomenon, occurring in biaxial crystals, was proposed. CR polarimeters are snapshot polarimeters that allow controlling the volume of data redundancy without an increase in the acquisition time. We present the implementation, calibration, and analysis of an incomplete CR-polarimeter optimized for the measure of linear polarizations. A simpler and cheaper experimental configuration is achieved, if compared with other polarimeters proposed in the literature. The suitability of the polarimeter is experimentally demonstrated and some of its benefits, such as its performance in low-intensity conditions, are discussed.},

abstract = {The relationship between system condition and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in reconstructed Stokes parameter images is investigated for rotating compensator, variable retardance, and rotating analyzer Stokes vector (SV) polarimeters. A variety of optimal configurations are presented for each class of systems. The operation of polarimeters is discussed in terms of a four-dimensional conical vector space; and the concept of nonorthogonal bases, frames, and tight frames is introduced to describe the operation of SV polarimeters. Although SNR is an important consideration, performance of a polarimeter in the presence of errors in the calibration and alignment of the optical components is also important. The relationship between system condition and error performance is investigated, and it is shown that an optimum system from the point of view of SNR is not always an optimum system with respect to error performance. A detailed theory of error performance is presented, and the error of a SV polarimeter is shown to be related to the stability and condition number of the polarization processing matrices. The rms error is found to fall off as the inverse of the number of measurements taken. Finally, the concepts used to optimize SV polarimeters are extended to be useful for full Mueller matrix polarimeters.},

abstract = {The polarization analysis of light is typically carried out using modulation schemes. The light of an unknown polarization state is passed through a set of known modulation optics, and a detector is used to measure the total intensity passing the system. The modulation optics is modified several times, and, with the aid of several such measurements, the unknown polarization state of the light can be inferred. How to find the optimal demodulation process has been investigated in the past. However, since the modulation matrix has to be measured for a given instrument and the optical elements can present problems of repeatability, some uncertainty is present in the elements of the modulation matrix or covariances between these elements. We analyze in detail this issue, presenting analytical formulas for calculating the covariance matrix produced by the propagation of such uncertainties on the demodulation matrix, on the inferred Stokes parameters, and on the efficiency of the modulation process. We demonstrate that even if the covariance matrix of the modulation matrix is diagonal, the covariance matrix of the demodulation matrix is in general nondiagonal because matrix inversion is a nonlinear operation. This propagates through the demodulation process and induces correlations on the inferred Stokes parameters.},

New degrees of freedom are attained by introducing abrupt phase changes over the scale of the wavelength. A two-dimensional array of optical resonators with spatially varying phase response and subwavelength separation can imprint such phase discontinuities on propagating light as it traverses the interface between two media. Anomalous reflection and refraction phenomena are observed in this regime in optically thin arrays of metallic antennas on silicon with a linear phase variation along the interface, which are in excellent agreement with generalized laws derived from Fermat's principle. Phase discontinuities provide great flexibility in the design of light beams, as illustrated by the generation of optical vortices through use of planar designer metallic interfaces.},

Astrophysicists employ polarization information to measure the spatial distribution of magnetic fields on the surface of the Sun. In the medical field, analysis of the polarization allows the diagnose of disease in the eyes. The retinae of most insect and certain vertebrate species are sensitive to polarization in their environment, but humans are blind to this property of light.
