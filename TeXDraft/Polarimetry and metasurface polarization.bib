abstract = {By relying on an advanced Jones calculus we analyze the polarization properties of light upon propagation through metamaterial slabs in a comprehensive manner. Based on symmetry considerations, we show that all periodic metamaterials may be divided into five different classes only. It is shown that each class differently affects the polarization of the transmitted light and sustains different eigenmodes. We show how to deduce these five classes from symmetry considerations and provide a simple algorithm that can be applied to decide by measuring transmitted intensities to which class a given metamaterial is belonging to only.},

abstract = {The relationship between system condition and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in reconstructed Stokes parameter images is investigated for rotating compensator, variable retardance, and rotating analyzer Stokes vector (SV) polarimeters. A variety of optimal configurations are presented for each class of systems. The operation of polarimeters is discussed in terms of a four-dimensional conical vector space; and the concept of nonorthogonal bases, frames, and tight frames is introduced to describe the operation of SV polarimeters. Although SNR is an important consideration, performance of a polarimeter in the presence of errors in the calibration and alignment of the optical components is also important. The relationship between system condition and error performance is investigated, and it is shown that an optimum system from the point of view of SNR is not always an optimum system with respect to error performance. A detailed theory of error performance is presented, and the error of a SV polarimeter is shown to be related to the stability and condition number of the polarization processing matrices. The rms error is found to fall off as the inverse of the number of measurements taken. Finally, the concepts used to optimize SV polarimeters are extended to be useful for full Mueller matrix polarimeters.},

abstract = {Polarization-difference (PD) imaging techniques have been demonstrated to improve the detectability of target features that are embedded in scattering media. The improved detectability occurs for both passive imaging in moderately scattering media ({\textless}5 optical depths) and active imaging in more highly scattering media. These improvements are relative to what is possible with equivalent polarization-blind, polarization-sum (PS) imaging under the same conditions. In this investigation, the point-spread functions (PSF's) for passive PS and PD imaging in single-scattering media are studied analytically, and Monte Carlo simulations are used to study the PSF's in single- and moderately multiple-scattering media. The results indicate that the PD PSF can be significantly narrower than the corresponding PS PSF, implying that better images of target features with high-spatial-frequency information can be obtained by using differential polarimetry in scattering media. Although the analysis was performed for passive imaging at moderate optical depths, the results lend insight into experiments that have been performed in more highly scattering media with active imaging methods to help mitigate the effects of multiple scattering.},

abstract = {The first three columns of the instrument matrix A of the four-detector photopolarimeter (FDP) are determined by Fourier analysis of the output current vector I(P) as a function of the azimuth angle P of the incident linearly polarized light. Therefore 12 of the 16 elements of A are measured free of the imperfections of the (absent) quarter-wave retarder (QWR). The effect of angular beam deviation by the polarizer is compensated for by taking the average, (1/2) $\backslash$[I(P) + I(P + 180{\{}$\backslash$textdegree{\}})$\backslash$], of the FDP output at 180{\{}$\backslash$textdegree{\}}-apart, optically equivalent, angular positions of the polarizer. The remaining fourth column of A is determined by the FDP's response to the right- and left-handed circular polarization states. Because these states are impossible to generate with an imperfect QWR, a novel procedure is developed. In particular, the response of the FDP to the unattainable right- or left-handed circular polarization state is found by taking the average of the responses of the FDP to an elliptical near-circular state and that state rotated in azimuth by 90{\{}$\backslash$textdegree{\}}. This calibration scheme is applied to measure A of our prototype FDP of four Si detectors at $\lambda$ = 632.8 nm. A is determined, in external and internal reference frames, free of imperfections in the polarizing optical elements. The FDP, with its uncontaminated A matrix, is used subsequently to evaluate the imperfections of the QWR with the help of an appropriate model.},

@article{Tyo1996,
abstract = {Polarization-difference imaging (PDI) was recently presented by us as a method of imaging through scattering media [Opt. Lett. 20, 608 (1995)]. Here, PDI is compared with conventional, polarizationblind imaging systems under a variety of conditions not previously studied. Through visual and numerical comparison of polarization-difference and polarization-sum images of metallic targets suspended in scattering media, target features initially visible in both types of images are shown to disappear in polarization-sum images as the scatterer concentration is increased, whereas these features remain visible in polarization-difference images. Target features producing an observed degree of linear polarization of less than 1{\%} are visible in polarization-difference images. The ability of PDI to suppress partially polarized background variations selectively is demonstrated, and discrimination of target features on the basis of polarization information is discussed. Our results show that, when compared with conventional imaging, PDI yields a factor of 2-3 increase in the distance at which certain target features can be detected.},

abstract = {Metasurfaces are planar structures that locally modify the polarization, phase and amplitude of light in reflection or transmission, thus enabling lithographically patterned flat optical components with functionalities controlled by design. Transmissive metasurfaces are especially important, as most optical systems used in practice operate in transmission. Several types of transmissive metasurface have been realized, but with either low transmission efficiencies or limited control over polarization and phase. Here, we show a metasurface platform based on high-contrast dielectric elliptical nanoposts that provides complete control of polarization and phase with subwavelength spatial resolution and an experimentally measured efficiency ranging from 72{\%} to 97{\%}, depending on the exact design. Such complete control enables the realization of most free-space transmissive optical elements such as lenses, phase plates, wave plates, polarizers, beamsplitters, as well as polarization-switchable phase holograms and arbitrary vector beam generators using the same metamaterial platform.},

Driven by their biomedical potential, the use of the polarimetric approaches for biological tissue assessment has also recently received considerable attention. Specifically, polarization can be used as an effective tool to discriminate against multiply scattered light (acting as a gating mechanism) in order to enhance contrast and to improve tissue imaging resolution. Moreover, the intrinsic tissue polarimetry characteristics contain a wealth of morphological and functional information of potential biomedical importance. However, in a complex random medium-like tissue, numerous complexities due to multiple scattering and simultaneous occurrences of many scattering and polarization events present formidable challenges both in terms of accurate measurements and in terms of analysis of the tissue polarimetry signal. In order to realize the potential of the polarimetric approaches for tissue imaging and characterization/diagnosis, a number of researchers are thus pursuing innovative solutions to these challenges. In this review paper, we summarize these and other issues pertinent to the polarized light methodologies in tissues. Specifically, we discuss polarized light basics, Stokes-Muller formalism, methods of polarization measurements, polarized light modeling in turbid media, applications to tissue imaging, inverse analysis for polarimetric results quantification, applications to quantitative tissue assessment, etc.},

abstract = {We demonstrate a broadband, thin-film, polarizing beam splitter based on an anisotropic diffraction grating composed of reactive mesogens (polymerizable liquid crystals). This achromatic polarization grating (PG) manifests high diffraction efficiency (approximately 100{\%}) and high extinction ratio ({\textgreater} or = 1000:1) in both theory and experiment. We show an operational bandwidth Deltalambda/lambda0 approximately 56{\%} (roughly spanning visible wavelength range) that represents more than a fourfold increase of bandwidth over conventional PGs (and significantly larger than any other grating). The diffraction angle and operational region (visible, near-infrared, midwave infrared, and ultraviolet wavelengths) may be easily tailored during fabrication. The essence of the achromatic design is a stack of two chiral PGs with an opposite twist sense and employs the principle of retardation compensation. We fully characterize its optical properties and derive the theoretical diffraction behavior.},

abstract = {We report an experimental implementation of long-range polarimetric imaging through fog over kilometric distance in real field atmospheric conditions. An incoherent polarized light source settled on a telecommunication tower is imaged at a distance of 1.3 km with a snapshot polarimetric camera including a birefringent Wollaston prism, allowing simultaneous acquisition of two images along orthogonal polarization directions. From a large number of acquisitions datasets and under various environmental conditions (clear sky/fog/haze, day/night), we compare the efficiency of using polarized light for source contrast increase with different signal representations (intensity, polarimetric difference, polarimetric contrast, etc.). With the limited-dynamics detector used, a maximum fourfold increase in contrast was demonstrated under bright background illumination using polarimetric difference image.},

Different polarization diffraction gratings are demonstrated, including linear polarization with horizontal, vertical and ± 45° orientations, and circular R and L polarization outputs. When illuminated with an arbitrary state of polarization, the system acts as a complete polarimeter where the intensities of the diffraction orders allow measurement of the Stokes parameters with a single shot. Experimental proof-of-concept is presented using a parallel-aligned liquid crystal display operating in a double pass architecture.},

@article{Layden2012,
abstract = {Dual photoelastic modulator polarimeter systems are widely used for the measurement of light beam polarization, most often described by Stokes vectors, that carry information about an interrogated sample. The sample polarization properties can be described more thoroughly through its Mueller matrix, which can be derived from judiciously chosen input polarization Stokes vectors and correspondingly measured output Stokes vectors. However, several sources of error complicate the construction of a Mueller matrix from the measured Stokes vectors. Here we present a general formalism to examine these sources of error and their effects on the derived Mueller matrix, and identify the optimal input polarization states to minimize their effects in a dual photoelastic modulator polarimeter configuration. The input Stokes vector states leading to the most robust Mueller matrix determination are shown to form Platonic solids in the Poincar{\'{e}} sphere space; we also identify the optimal 3D orientation of these solids for error minimization.},

The polarization-selective behavior of the devices is described by a compact formalism based on Stokes vectors that offers a clear graphical representation of the response. We experimentally observe polarization-controlled switching and unidirectional coupling with extinction ratios greater than 30 dB and coupling efficiencies comparable to those of a conventional grating coupler.},

@article{Hall2013,
abstract = {A robust way of measuring the optical properties of any material is to interrogate it with light of different polarizations. The 16-element Mueller matrix provides the most complete description of the optical properties of a sample based on its ability to alter the polarization state of transmitted or reflected light. This is valuable for ordered and isotropic materials alike. Similarly, the 4-element Stokes vector is the most complete description of the polarization of a light beam, including any depolarization effects. While the Mueller matrix offers the most chemical and physical insight, the Stokes vectors are easier to obtain, and there are more schemes for measuring them quickly in situations where time resolution is important. We describe a method where any Stokes polarimeter may be adapted to obtain Mueller matrices and discuss various approaches for achieving better time resolution.},
