abstract = {In the quest to miniaturise photonics, it is of paramount importance to control light at the nanoscale. We reveal the main physical mechanism responsible for operation of gap plasmon-based gradient metasurfaces, comprising a periodic arrangement of metal nanobricks, and suggest that two degrees of freedom in the nanobrick geometry allow one to independently control the reflection phases of orthogonal light polarisations. We demonstrate, both theoretically and experimentally, how orthogonal linear polarisations of light at wavelengths close to 800 nm can be manipulated independently, efficiently and in a broad wavelength range by realising polarisation beam splitters and polarisation-independent beam steering, showing at the same time the robustness of metasurface designs towards fabrication tolerances. The presented approach establishes a new class of compact optical components, viz., plasmonic metasurfaces with controlled gradient birefringence, with no dielectric counterparts. It can straightforwardly be adapted to realise new optical components with hitherto inaccessible functionalities.},

abstract = {The concept of an ultra-thin metasurface made of single layer of only-dielectric disks for successful phase control over a full range is demonstrated. Conduction loss is avoided compared to its plasmonic counterpart. The interaction of the Mie resonances of the first two modes of the dielectric particles, magnetic and electric dipoles, is tailored by the dimensions of the disks, providing required phase shift for the transmitted beam from 0 degrees to 360 degrees , together with high transmission efficiency. The successful performance of a beam-tilting array and a large-scale lens functioning at 195 THz demonstrates the ability of the dielectric metasurface that is thin and has also high efficiency of more than 80{\%}. Such configurations can serve as outstanding alternatives for plasmonic metasurfaces especially that it can be a scalable design.},

abstract = {Holography, a revolutionary 3D imaging technique, has been developed for storing and recovering the amplitude and phase of light scattered by objects. Later, single-beam computer-generated phase holography was proposed for restoring the wavefront from a given incidence. However, because the phase modulation depends on the light propagation inside the material, the thickness of phase holograms usually remains comparable to the wavelength. Here we experimentally demonstrate ultra-thin metasurface holograms that operate in the visible range whose thickness is only 30 nm (approximately 1/23 of the operational wavelength). To our knowledge, this is the thinnest hologram that can provide both amplitude and phase modulation in the visible wavelength range, which generates high-resolution low-noise images. Using this technique, not only the phase, but potentially the amplitude of the incident wave can be efficiently controlled, expanding the route to new applications of ultra-thin and surface-confined photonic devices.},

In relation to birefringent metal-backed metasurfaces, we show how a combination of metal nanobrick and nanocross elements allows one to fully control the phase of reflected light for two orthogonal polarizations simultaneously. The approach is exemplified by the design of a gradient birefringent metasurface that reflects two orthogonal polarization states into +2 and -3 diffraction order, respectively, with a reflectivity up to {\~{}} 80{\%} and in a broad wavelength range around the design wavelength of 800 nm. Finally, we introduce the concept of metascatterers, which are wavelength-sized polarization-sensitive scatterers.},

abstract = {Metasurfaces are planar structures that locally modify the polarization, phase and amplitude of light in reflection or transmission, thus enabling lithographically patterned flat optical components with functionalities controlled by design. Transmissive metasurfaces are especially important, as most optical systems used in practice operate in transmission. Several types of transmissive metasurface have been realized, but with either low transmission efficiencies or limited control over polarization and phase. Here, we show a metasurface platform based on high-contrast dielectric elliptical nanoposts that provides complete control of polarization and phase with subwavelength spatial resolution and an experimentally measured efficiency ranging from 72{\%} to 97{\%}, depending on the exact design. Such complete control enables the realization of most free-space transmissive optical elements such as lenses, phase plates, wave plates, polarizers, beamsplitters, as well as polarization-switchable phase holograms and arbitrary vector beam generators using the same metamaterial platform.},

abstract = {Plasmonic metasurfaces have recently attracted much attention due to their ability to abruptly change the phase of light, allowing subwavelength optical elements for polarization and wavefront control. However, most previously demonstrated metasurface designs suffer from low coupling efficiency and are based on metallic resonators, leading to ohmic loss. Here, we present an alternative approach to plasmonic metasurfaces by replacing the metallic resonators with high-refractive-index silicon cut-wires in combination with a silver ground plane. We experimentally demonstrate that this meta-reflectarray can be used to realize linear polarization conversion with more than 98{\%} conversion efficiency over a 200 nm bandwidth in the short-wavelength infrared band. We also demonstrate optical vortex beam generation using a meta-reflectarray with an azimuthally varied phase profile. The vortex beam generation is shown to have high efficiency over a wavelength range from 1500 to 1600 nm. The use of dielectric resonators in place of their plasmonic counterparts could pave the way for ultraefficient metasurface-based devices at high frequencies.},

Near-unity transmittance efficiency and close to 0-2pi phase coverage are enabled by utilizing the localized electric and magnetic Mie-type resonances of low-loss silicon nanoparticles tailored to behave as electromagnetically dual-symmetric scatterers. We apply this concept to realize a metadevice that converts a Gaussian beam into a vortex beam.

abstract = {Two-dimensional metasurface structures have recently been proposed to reduce the challenges of fabrication of traditional plasmonic metamaterials. However, complex designs and sophisticated fabrication procedures are still required. Here, we present a unique one-dimensional (1-D) metasurface based on bilayered metallic nanowire gratings, which behaves as an ideal polarized beam splitter, producing strong negative reflection for transverse-magnetic (TM) light and efficient reflection for transverse-electric (TE) light. The large anisotropy resulting from this TE-metal-like/TM-dielectric-like feature can be explained by the dispersion curve based on the Bloch theory of periodic metal-insulator-metal waveguides. The results indicate that this photon manipulation mechanism is fundamentally different from those previously proposed for 2-D or 3-D metastructures. Based on this new material platform, a novel form of metasurface holography is proposed and demonstrated, in which an image can only be reconstructed by using a TM light beam. By reducing the metamaterial structures to 1-D, our metasurface beam splitter exhibits the qualities of cost-efficient fabrication, robust performance, and high tunability, in addition to its applicability over a wide range of working wavelengths and incident angles. This development paves a foundation for metasurface structure designs towards practical metamaterial applications.},

abstract = {Ultrathin metasurfaces have recently emerged as promising materials that have huge potential to enable novel, flat optical components, and surface-confined, miniature photonic devices. Metasurfaces offer new degrees of freedom in molding the optical wavefronts by introducing abrupt and drastic changes in the amplitude, phase, and/or polarization of electromagnetic radiation at the wavelength scale. By carefully arranging multiple subwavelength anisotropic or gradient optical resonators, metasurfaces have been shown to enable anomalous transmission, anomalous reflection, optical holograms, and spin-orbit interaction. However, experimental realization of high-performance metasurfaces that can operate at visible frequency range has been a significant challenge due to high optical losses of plasmonic materials and difficulties in fabricating several plasmonic resonators of subwavelength size with high uniformity. Here, we propose a highly efficient yet a simple metasurface design comprising of a single, anisotropic silver antenna in its unit cell. We demonstrate broadband (450-850 nm) anomalous reflection and spectrum splitting at visible and near-IR frequencies with high conversion efficiency. Average power ratio of anomalous reflection to the strongest diffraction mode was calculated to be on the order of 10(3) and measured to be on the order of 10. The anomalous reflected photons have been visualized using a charge-coupled device camera, and broadband spectrum splitting performance has been confirmed experimentally using a free space, angle-resolved reflection measurement setup. Metasurface design proposed in this study is a clear departure from conventional metasurfaces utilizing multiple, anisotropic and/or gradient optical resonators and could enable high-efficiency, broadband metasurfaces for achieving flat high signal-to-noise ratio optical spectrometers, polarization beam splitters, directional emitters, and spectrum splitting surfaces for photovoltaics.},

The differences$\backslash$namong the phase modulations result from the differences among the$\backslash$neffective indices exhibited in the subwavelength structures with$\backslash$nvarious filling factors and surface profiles, and the phase retardations$\backslash$nare obtained by the relief depth of the structures. The polarization-selective$\backslash$nproperty is achieved by the polarization dependence of the effective$\backslash$nindices exhibited in the one-dimensional subwavelength structures$\backslash$nand the polarization independence exhibited in the two-dimensional$\backslash$nstructures. Additionally, the polarization contrast of our polarization-multiplexed$\backslash$nelements, defined as the cross talk between the two polarization$\backslash$nincidences, is independent of the relief depth. The principle of$\backslash$nthe polarization multiplexing by use of the subwavelength structures$\backslash$nis described, and the fabrication results for the polarization-multiplexed$\backslash$ncomputer-generated holograms are demonstrated.
